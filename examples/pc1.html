    <p>Computing, especially scientific computing, tends to be associated with neutrality and objectivity. There is a sense that they are detached from ‘flawed’ human senses and reasoning. <a href="https://dhq.digitalhumanities.org/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html" target="_blank">Johanna Drucker argues</a> that this is especially obvious (and dangerous) in the domain of data visualisation. The data are presented free of context -- the context in which it was created and the context of its creator.<p>
    <p>Drucker argues that “[b]ecause realist approaches to visualization assume transparency and equivalence, as if the phenomenal world were self-evident and the apprehension of it a mere mechanical task, they are fundamentally at odds with approaches to humanities scholarship premised on constructivist principles”. As a counter, she calls for the new paradigms of visualisation which forefront positionality and context and offers several prototypic examples.</p>
    <p>A ‘standard’ bar chart, for Drucker, is lacking, in that it only displays a single discrete measurement without giving any sense of how that value was arrived at -- of the ‘constructedness’ of the data. Her alternative version, depicting the ‘appearance’ of 19th century novels augments a ‘typical’ chart whose vertical bars represent the number of novels whole publication date fell within a given year with sometimes disjoint horizontal bars made up of distinct symbols each representing a step of the publication process (writing, editing, pre-press etc.); This addition is intended to contextualise the vertical bar, elucidating its composition.</p>

    <p>Another example mutates standard units of measurement to introduce a new type of axis that, rather than being constrained to linear and uniform progression, twists and warps to reflect human perception of time.</p>

    <p>“So naturalized are the Google maps and bar charts generated from spread sheets that they pass as unquestioned representations of what ‘is’”, argues Drucker; this, she asserts, is problematic in DH because these ‘standard’ representations were developed in a non-humanistic epistemological setting and correspondingly embody values and assumptions that often oppose those of humanistic inquiry -- namely, that information can be decontextual and observer independent. In DH, it is important to critically attend to how contexts and perspectives are implicitly or explicitly represented.</p>
