    <p>Distant Reading is one of the earliest and most widespread approaches associated with DH. Rather than focusing on the details of a small number of examples, this alternative to typical ‘close reading’ uses quantitative statistical methods to study literature and other cultural phenomena on a large scale in terms of patterns and trends. </p>
    <p><a href=”https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YL2kvMIF8hEC&oi=fnd&pg=PP12&dq=graphs+maps+and+trees+moretti&ots=wreE-67SCf&sig=T9rx1gZA6jRzBdXD8yddYcDzryo&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=graphs%20maps%20and%20trees%20moretti&f=false” target=”_blank”>Franco Moretti</a>, who coined the term, argued that distant reading stood to transform the field of literary studies by expanding its scope beyond a limited set of canonical texts that had dominated the field under the paradigm of close reading. With distant reading, he insisted, we could read so much more. Detractors of Moretti argue that distant reading isn’t really <i>reading</i> at all. Computational processing of texts requires that they be broken down into individual tokens -- most often, words -- and often that these be normalised in some way. These tokens are often subsequently used as part of aggregations, removing them from their contexts and therefore, some would argue, stripping them of meaning.</p>
    <p>Other scholars argue, however, that despite looking different and drawing on different aspects of texts, distant reading maintains the crucial interpretative aspect. Though the act of processing the text itself may be mechanistic, <a href=”https://libraries.uh.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ramsay-The-Hermeneutics-of-Screwing-Around.pdf” target=”_blank”>the design of the models is an act of interpretation</a>, of hypothesisation. The intervention of the digital creates new conventions, “<a href=”https://culturalanalytics.org/article/11062.pdf” target=”_blank”>forcing us to rethink our current disciplinary practices in the humanities from the ground up</a>. What counts as evidence? What is the relationship between theory and practice? How do we account for the technological mediations of our critique?” </p>
    <p>Computation has particular strengths and limitations. Computers are much faster than humans at processing large amounts of information but lack, for instance, the capacity to cope with ambiguity or make inferences without specific instruction; no human can read a million books, but <a href=”https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/757C1225CFDCF629FC2895C76DD747B0/S0030812900116098a.pdf/why_distant_reading_isnt.pdf” target=”_blank”>“no text- analysis program weeps when it reads the passages in Felix Salten’s Bambi in which Bambi’s mother dies”</a>. When we decide to introduce computation into scholarship, we are making a choice to pose research questions in a way that conforms to these strengths and weaknesses. The key skill in DH work is to be able to determine whether the specific demands of different kinds of computational encoding and processing align with the core aims of our research questions.</p>
