    <p><i>Data</i>, argue some DH scholars, is not the most accurate name for it. The word comes from the latin for ‘given’, which implies passivity. They advocate instead for the term <i>Capta</i>, signifying ‘taken’, which better describes the fact that data is a construction created from a specific perspective, and embodies a specific set of values and beliefs. Two people, faced with the same source or phenomenon, could encode it in two vastly different ways.</p>
    <p>In her work on data-driven government policy and Australian indigenous communities, <a href="https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/ielapa.586241932732209" target="_blank">Maggie Walter characterises the data resulting from the prevailing paradigm as BADDR</a> - Blaming, Aggregate, Decontextualised, Deficit, and Restrictive. There is an underlying assumption that indigenous people are a problem because they do not fit into western governmental conventions, and this is reflected in the metrics designed to describe them. Metrics which do not take into account  indigenous worldviews, values, and priorities will inevitably find them wanting.</p>
    <p>In line with the idea of ‘capta’, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ycP_AAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA5&ots=NNf-_mv50t&sig=zNnpuv59-zsLjFJA7l0sT72iTb0&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">Walter proposes <i>nayri kati</i></a> -- ‘good numbers’, in the palawa Tasmanian Aboriginal language -- as a counterpoint to BADDR data. Broadly, <i>nayri kati</i> refers to metrics emerging from standpoint-informed methodologies. As <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13645579.2018.1531228?casa_token=t7-Sr2wZZ3EAAAAA:2D663cxmZbEIvpS0mseHj7H12hYiBhlLBl4MHoRUXvExQzNgBgd3dAs0ywFUzEpBeTT_JUU4wi8A" target="_blank">an example</a> of <i>nayri kati</i> in practice, she points to the work of the the Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Centre, who, instead of metrics and data practices grounded in “western constructions of the world and numbers” changed to adopt an indigenous quantitative methodological approach that takes into account the fact that "for Indigenous peoples, health is not just about maintaining physical health, such as through exercise or taking medications to prevent and manage diseases, it is connected to their ways of being and doing that are unique to their identity and understanding of the world [...] for example, a way of life that supports wellness and spirituality and ceremonies, traditional medicine, heritage languages, family and community connectedness, agricultural way of life, and physical wellness".</p>
    <p>On a much less granular front, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/603274662.pdf">Canadian Indigenous scholar John Corbett felt that western data and computational paradigms were in tension with his identity and beliefs as <i>nehiyaw</i>-Métis</a>. Corbett describes how, in his journey learning computing, he continually fought to avoid "conforming to the design and language of the computer", instead "breaking and rewriting as many computational rules as possible" (e.g. altering things to be less efficient, but more reflective of the processes he was modelling) to instead have "the computer understand how I wanted to [process/create information]" -- in a way that was reflective of an Indigenous worldview. This experience culminated in his creation of <i>Cree#</i>, a programming language that is Indigenous in its structure, symbology, syntax, and purpose. It is built around the metaphor of 'code as story' and written entirely in Aboriginal Syllabics. The declaration of a function translates to 'this is a collected story called [function name]', and the keywords for looping and conditionals are drawn for natural metaphors. The act of 'smudging', which is a cleansing ritual, has been computationally transcribed as a command which prepares the program for running by clearing the screen and any cached memory. An intended possible output of a <i>Cree#</i> program is a rendering of beaded artwork that is a traditional means of encoding and transmitting stories.</p>

    <p>Walter writes that “research standpoint is a fundamental component of all methodologies, not just Indigenous ones” and that “the failure to recognize one’s standpoint in fact magnifies, rather than mitigates, its influence on research practice”. Walter’s  <i>nayri kati</i> and Corbett’s <i>Cree#</i> are both examples of a <i>humanistic</i> approach to the quantitative and computational that explicitly recognises and attends to positionality.</p>
