      <p>The data we create is Digital Humanities can only ever be a partial simplified representation of the phenomenon or source it is intended to capture. </p>
      <p>Sometimes, the dimensions that are left out simply <i>can’t</i> be captured. The <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/" target="_blank"><i>Shakespeare and Company Project</i></a> is a DH project based around the borrowing records of the famous Parisian mile-0 lending library and bookstore of the same name. The project is interested in reconstructing and interrogating the reading practices of the “the century’s most influential writers, along with hundreds of other artists, intellectuals, and students who lived in Paris between the two world wars”.</p>
      <p>Their <a href="https://culturalanalytics.org/article/32551-shakespeare-and-company-project-data-sets" target="_blank">data</a> comes from library lending cards and member address books, which report on the members’ locations and borrowing histories, as well as log books which provide information on Shakespeare and Company’s revenue and expenses. These original records are full of gaps -- sometimes due to lost or destroyed documents and other times simply because of lax human record keeping. They are also full of errors and inconsistencies; new subscription fees were sometimes marked as renewals (and vice versa) and some deposits and fees seemed only to apply to those who were not friends of the owner…</p>
      <p>These gaps and inconsistencies are replicated in the relational database the project created from the primary sources, but they present challenges to methods of computational analysis that “assume consistent patterns”. DH is of course not the only field that has to deal with lacunar data, and other disciplines have developed ways of trying to fill in missing values.  <i>Shakespeare and Company Project</i> researchers Rebecca Sutton Koeser and Zoe LeBlanc <a href="https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/koeser-leblanc-missing-data-speculative-reading#_ftn3" target="_blank">trialed methods</a> used in financial forecasting and conservation biology to estimate possible values. In some cases, the generated values seem plausible if highly uncertain, but in others are called into doubt when running them on known data yields results inconsistent with actual values.</p>
      <p>Koeser and Sutton conclude that, though the level of uncertainty in these predictions means that they should not be treated as fact and integrated into further analysis, it is useful for Digital Humanists to investigate gaps, as they open up new questions and avenues of exploration. They propose a practice of ‘speculative reading’ that moves "the margins of our analyses to the center", framing "missingness as something that we can consider as an object of study outright".</p>
      <p>We also need to consider the question of what we <i>choose</i> not to capture. Nothing, for instance, about the materiality of the Shakespeare and Company source materiality was encoded -- which sorts of research questions might that choice have foreclosed?</p>
      <!--from here on might have too much overlap with question #2-->
      <p>Just a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fcjYjSPXCztD5rwA8" target="_blank">short walk</a> from the <i>Shakespeare and Company</i> bookshop in modern day Paris is the <i>Comédie-Française</i>, spiritual home of another famous playwright, Molière. Scholars of the <i><a href="https://www.cfregisters.org/#!/" target="_blank">Comédie-Française Registers Project</a></i> have digitised and created databases from the company’s daily financial, casting, and administrative registers reaching back to its inception in 1680. These records provide a different way of looking at French theatre history, bringing to light <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/01610775-10118805" target="_blank">previously overlooked figures</a> such as Monsieur Bellmont -- an actor who was scarcely mentioned in the press at the time as he was not considered particularly talented, but who was an absolute backbone of the troupe, performing more frequently than any of his contemporaries by a long shot. However, the choices made in creating these databases also perpetuate and create different priorities. A typical page in the daily revenue registers includes the plays performed, ticket types, prices, and amounts sold, and, sometimes additional notes at the bottom about anything from notable audience members to administrative nitty gritty.</p>
      <div class=img-container><img src="style/images/recettes_notes.png"></img></div>
      <p>Not featured are the names of the authors of the plays, but the researchers decided to systematically add this endogenous field when creating the database. What they chose not to do, on the other hand, was process the page notes, which frequently contained the names of other people involved in the theatre -- from the administrators all the way down to the prompters. These agents, unlike the authors, do not have a dedicated space in the database.</p>
      <p>In choosing what to include and exclude in their database schema, the <i>Comédie-Française Registers Project</i> team made certain kinds of research questions easier and more obvious to pursue. In DH it is important that we recognise and interrogate these sorts of embedded values.</p>
