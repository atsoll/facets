    <p>‘Thinkering’ is a portmanteau that DH scholars at the University of Luxembourg have put forward to describe a humanistic mode of computational work that “combines playful tinkering with critical thinking”. <a hre=”https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1891960/FULLTEXT01.pdf#page=39” target=”_blank”>They are looking to promote the closer pairing of computational processing and critical interpretive reflection and have created DH several tools designed to support this approach</a>.<p>
    <p>One of these tools is actually a paired set, <a href=”https://docs.dharpa.org/” target=”_blank”><i>kiara</i></a> and <i>Lumy</i>, which together create a research environment to help digital humanists create and analyse networks. <i>kiara</i>, which is the backend that handles the code functionality, allows users to create and chain together modules to create a network-analysis pipeline. Each module is completely transparent - specified by expected input and output, process description, and associated process python code. What really sets <i>kiara</i> apart from other network-analysis tools is its emphasis on action-tracking metadata; it keeps a tree-structured log of every user interaction, allowing the user to reflect on their process and easily trace the 'lineage' of any data result.</p>

    <p> <i>Lumy</i>, still in its design phase, is similarly intended to "encourage users to adopt recursive, self-reflexive and reproducible work practices". It will sit on top of <i>kiara</i>, offering GUI access to the network manipulation functionality in one part of the interface, while also providing space in another panel for the user to take notes on their practice, including adding source links and images. The aim of associating metadata snapshots with researcher reflections is to "cultivat[e] the holistic practice of interweaving methodology, data, code, and metadata with a narrative of researcher's choices and actions". This deliberate pairing of the "the ability to record what the software is doing with the ability to record what the scholar is doing" brings the interpretation underlying the use of computational tools to the forefront.</p>

    <p>The computational processes that lead to a result or digital artifact can be difficult to interrogate - hidden by the propensity for blackboxing that permeates computing. However, because of the centrality of interpretation to humanistic inquiry, DH work needs to try to  unpack these black boxes and make this implicit interpretation explicit. <i>kiara</i> and <i>Lumy</i> are one example of what this can look like.</p>
