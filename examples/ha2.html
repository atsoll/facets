    <p>AI tools are, in DH as in other disciplines, becoming more and more popular. However their biases and opacity -- specifically insofar as the latter makes it difficult to understand the former -- can be problematic when they are used as part of the process of interpretation.</p>
    <p><a href=”https://research.reading.ac.uk/digitalhumanities/bringing-history-to-life-animating-historical-portraits-with-artificial-intelligence/” target=”_blank”>The use of Generative AI in to colorise, modernise, and animate historical portraits, argues Cate Alexander, results in “not so much a digital restoration as a digital facelift”.</a></p>
    <p>Generative AI tools, by virtue of how they are constructed, tend toward homogeneity and dominant ideals. When applied to historical images, this means that the ‘new’ versions become warped in a way that brings them closer to modern standards of beauty -- changing bone structure, feature placement, and face shape; adding dramatic makeup; and “most problematically”, whitening their skin.</p>

    <p>Alexander highlights that one purpose of these reconstructions is in part to bring to life and “create intimacy” with these historical figures. This approach chimes with humanistic notions of challenging the supremacy of the rational and introducing affect into scholarship. However, the AI digital reconstructions are not the product of the kind of in-depth and nuanced research typical of history scholarship, which explains the process of interpretation, but of opaque digital processing that “reinforce[s] modern gender normativity and fetishization of whiteness — devaluing diversity and accuracy”.</p>
    <p>The humanities and interested in comparing and contrasting interpretations; AI tools (and many other computational techniques) are working toward consensus. It is crucial that, in DH, we attend to this tension, thinking critically about what goes into machine ‘interpretation’ and how that process differs from human interpretation.</p>
