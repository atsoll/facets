    <p>When working with computer scientists on digital visualisation tools, art historians on <i>Project Cornelia</i> were left feeling that <a href=”https://vis4dh.dbvis.de/papers/2018/When%20the%20Tech%20Kids%20are%20Running%20Too%20Fast%20%20Data%20Visualisation%20Through%20the%20Lens%20of%20Art%20History%20Research.pdf” target=”_blank”>"the tech kids are running too fast”. Houda Lamqaddam — one of the 'tech kids' — explains that the art historians found speed of development and release was at odds with the "contemplative nature of their research". Artworks, through the methodological lens of art historians, are "elements that trigger reflection rather than contain answers", an outlook that contrasts digital interfaces which "present the user with synthesized views of data and answers to research questions". </p>
    <p>Contributions in art history, due to the inherent subjectivity of the field, "often consist of making a claim denoting a unique perspective" —  one that is based in "in-depth artwork analysis" that "put[s] into evidence previously unexplored nuances". Lamqaddam explains that, for the art historians  "the use of aggregates, statistics and data-crunching algorithms by computer scientists is viewed as an approach where the reflection and the nuance disappear" -- it “threatens their operational paradigm".</p>
    <p>One possible explanation of the tensions between the art historians and developers in the <i>Cornelia</i> team is a mismatch between disciplinary approaches to <i>interpretation</i>.</p>
    <p>Interpretation is how information becomes knowledge; this sense-making is inherently a part of any discipline. There is a common process of <a href=”https://web.archive.org/web/20171001050920id_/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1351677.pdf” target=”_blank”>pattern matching and formalisation</a> —  a collection of examples will be interpreted to propose a more or less abstract theory demonstrating or explaining a phenomenon}. Where domains differ is in the emphasis they place on aspects of this process. The heart of the scholarship for the art historians is the process by which they arrived at their conclusions. They were discomforted by the work of the developers as the work of interpretation, on the part of developers, that went into the choice of encoding entities and relationships to illustrate specific theories of connection was, if not hidden, certainly not easily legible to the historians presented with the finished interface. To the historians, the developers appeared to have sped past the essential process of interpretation altogether. </p>
    <p>DH is caught between two divergent traditions of interpretation (two different <i>Hermeneutic</i> traditions): in the humanities, the core of the work is the juxtaposition of different interpretations; in computing, interpretation disappears once it is codified into convention. DH scholarship needs to try to elucidate the interpretation that goes into computational work in order for it also to be considered valid humanistic knowledge-creation.</p>
