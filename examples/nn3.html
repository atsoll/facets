    <p>In a name-based search of the <i>Papers of Thomas Jefferson Digital Edition</i> -- a digital collection of a significant portion of the man's correspondence -- <a href="https://lklein.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/661.full_.final_.pdf" target="_blank">Lauren Klein was surprised to find no results for James Hemings</a>, despite the central role the enslaved man played in Jefferson's diplomatic dealings in his capacity as household chef. Her attempt at a global search turned up a single first-name mention, identifiable as Hemings only through a researcher's metadata note.</p>
    <p>The <i>Papers of Thomas Jefferson Digital Edition</i> is an epistolary archive organised and indexed according to the senders and recipients of letters. Though the content is <i>available</i>, the choices around digital encoding and organisation did not make it <i>accessible</i>.</p>
    <p><b>But Klein knew it could be.</b></p>
    <p>She went about creating a new resource, The Hemmings Papers, centering James Hemmings. Using natural language processing techniques such as named entity recognition and co-reference extraction on the <i>contents</i> of a subset of letters, she identified mentions of Hemmings and other enslaved individuals and their interactions with Jefferson.  This ‘deformation’ disrupts structures of power enshrined in the original resources:  "rather than privilege the relationships between letter writers, I sought to dismantle the letter as the unit of the archive, examining each word of content on equal plane". From this transformation of the information, she created exploratory node-link graphics that visualised the frequency of Jefferson’s correspondence about Hemmings and, more significantly, his day-to-day interactions with various people, including slaves.</p>
    <div class="img-container"><img src="style/images/klein_jefferson.png"/></div>
    <p>In these graphics, she observes that "the arcs that link Jefferson to the men and women he enslaved are much more prominent than those that link him to his family members and friends", which "conjures a sense of the dependence, on the part of Jefferson, on the men and women he enslaved, even as it cannot recreate what these people said in their conversations, where they went in order to conduct their transactions, and how they truly lived their everyday lives."</p>
    <p>Though digital methods may have, in one instance, re-entrenched power dynamics, they equally have a disruptive capacity.</p>
