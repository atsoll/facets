    <p>Digital objects and interfaces all have an inherent rhetoric; the information they include, the ways in which they display it, and the interactions they permit are all in service of a specific argument. This is more obvious in some cases than others.</p>
    <p><a href=”https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1527476419857679?casa_token=ecx51n_U0hQAAAAA:xhggLiqbchXnXuNcs1AKu8A7aPPDOojUcBjb7zv6cBM6k1Dqa7Ejsn3NpipUWqtDpNZz1l9ORWno” target=_blank>Roopika Risam explicates the notion of interface-as-argument through the comparison of two visualisations of global migration</a>. The first, <i>The Flow Towards Europe</i> (FTE), was produced by a Finnish startup using a dataset from the United Nations Refugee Agency. It depicts  migration towards Europe from African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries with waves of dots moving in straight lines from source to destination.</p>

    <p><i>Crossing the Mediterranean Sea by Boat</i>(CMSB), her second example, conversely looks to convince through a focus on individual experience. CMSB is a collection of story maps built around interviews with over 250 migrants. Representations of migration are accompanied by motivations (e.g. 'escaping sexual violence', 'escaping civil war') and navigation between migrant stories is based on familial and relational bonds (e.g. 'brother', 'young mother'), "offer[ing] humanizing representations of migrants by placing them within social relations." Each story map includes stops made along the way and integrates the voices of migrants through quotations describing their journeys. Risam highlights that the visualisation does not shy away from assuming a specific position; alongside the visualisations, it directly puts questions to the user such as 'Unauthorised journeys through Europe are often frayed with dangers, and many have died trying to reach their destinations. Does this change your views on the need to open legal ways for people to travel?' and 'On arrival to their destination, many wait long periods during the asylum process while trying to learn about the rules and regulations in a new country. Can you imagine what it feels like to be waiting in this situation?'. </p>

    <p>The crux of her argument, however, is that the choices underlying FTE are no less of an assumed stance. She argues that the "[u]se of a political map absent of topographical features emphasizes national borders and depicts cohesion of the nation state (however fictive)". The choice of the map also creates a focus on the impact of migration on the \textit{destinations }-- some origin points are even out of frame. Risam further points to the fact that the movement of the dots in "unimpeded waves" serves to "emphasiz[e] the magnitude of migration" but does not reflect how migration "take[s] many more forms than travel from point A to point B [and] does not occur uniformly over time in the flows depicted in the visualisation". In order to produce the uniformity needed to apply the chosen methods, the team behind FTE created departure dates not included in the original dataset and calculated using arrival dates and average human walking speed. They also chose to aggregate the migrants; each dot actually represents a group of 25 individuals (who were not necessarily travelling together). This decision was notably "determined by the limitations of the visualization platform and the creators' sense that if each migrant were represented by a dot, the visualization would be too crowded and create performance issues". </p>
    <p>CMSB made an argument which aimed to convince through emotion and individuality. FTE made an argument looking to convince through clarity and volume. Crucially, <i>both</i> are arguments, despite that some might describe key aspects of the latter as ‘convention’. In DH, we look to cultivate the skill of both reading arguments in existing digital artifacts and explicitly writing them into new ones.</p>
