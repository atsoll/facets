    <p>When we look at a digital archive, what we might consider a complete resource in reality <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/126/3/1102/6421763" target="_blank">“represents many layers of appraisal decisions, many records that did not make the digitization cut, and, subsequently, an exponential multitude of silences”</a>.</p>
    <p>DH Scholars Alexandra Ortolja-Baird and Julianne Nyhan describe archives as <a href="https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/43343438/fqab065.pdf" target="_blank">‘haunted’</a> by the spectres of those whose voices have been excluded - intentionally or unintentionally - by conservation choices invariably underwritten by political and cultural contexts and biases. Every archive has a kind of negative image that remains unexamined and, correspondingly, uninterrogated. In their case study of collections of Hans Sloane—collections that notably seeded the modern British Museum—the ghosts are the non-western (primarily African) individuals who were the original creators and users of the culturally significant objects:“...the majority of individuals who either willingly or unwillingly contributed to the collection from beyond Europe were enslaved, coerced, or unremunerated for their efforts, and are irretrievable as Sloane remained silent about the original creators, users, and traders of his objects, despite recording the names of the western collectors who subsequently contributed these objects to Sloane’s cabinet”.</p>
    <p>The conspicuous absence of provenance and transit information further erases the way that slavery and colonialism are woven into the fabric of the collection. The networks of influence that permitted Sloane to amass the items were networks of “global trade and imperial expansion”, and a significant portion of the funds came through his wife’s family, who were prominent slave owners in Jamaica.</p>
    <p>The authors note that, when information relative to how locals used the objects was included, it was “treated dismissively as evidence of regressive or superstitious practices” and, crucially, “filtered and interpreted through western lenses”. In an act of what Ariella Aïsha Azoulay calls “taxonomic violence”, alternative ways of understanding and organising the world were forced into western frameworks and, in this act, their power and nuance lost.</p>
    <p>It is essential, in DH, to consider the impact of filtering through the lens of the <b>digital</b>, which has its own set of norms and gold standards. Computational methods require discrete encodings and thrive on consistent, quantified, and ample data. These conditions can in some cases influence data selection and transformation (e.g. simplifying categorization) that would seem to go against humanistic values. </p>
    <p>Historian of Slavery, Jessica Marie Johnson describes how, in the context of her field, catering to the strengths of the digital can often mean <a href="https://dssrf2023.blogs.bucknell.edu/files/2023/06/Johnson-2018-Markup-Bodies-Black-Life-Studies-and-Slavery-D.pdf" target="_blank">choosing to use the documentation of slavers as a primary source, meaning that the corresponding databases “reinscribe enslaved Africans’ biometrics as users transfer the racial nomenclature of the time period (négre, moreno, quadroon) into the present and encode skin color, hair texture, height, weight, age, and gender in new digital forms, replicating the surveilling actions of slave owners and slave traders.” The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, for instance, was compiled from slave trader ship manifests and logs, and colonia trade and census documents. Johnson highlights how, despite the profound impact this resource had on scholarship, “immediately reshap[ing’ debates about numbers of women and children exported from the continent, influencing work on women in the slave trade on the Afri can coast, slavery in African societies, and women in the slave trade to the Americas”, it failed to render black individuals as human; they “remained faceless, anonymous, disembodied”.</p>
    <p>Digital formats and methods demand a certain level of abstraction and formalisation. Though by virtue of interacting with archives, questions of the impacts of structured and rigorous organisation are not foreign to many humanists, these choices are arguably less noticeable in a digital context, passed off as neutral requirements of the machine. Correspondingly, Digital Humanists must be even more attentive to the question of such choices.</p>
